This is a repository where a) all the parts of my website are updated by Glitch and b) all of the source code for my website is stored.
A point of clarification: in the place of sensible img or other asset links, you may see absurdly long links to god knows where. Fear not:
these are just links to the "assets" section of Glitch, in which all of my images are hosted.

This single-page website was made using HTML5, CSS3, W3.CSS, and Vue.js.
